select * from trip_data
where delay_sec > 300
order by delay_sec DESC

-- 4. Count the total number of unique stops across all routes.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT stop_id) AS total_unique_stops
FROM route_stops;

-- 5. Find the average passenger rating per route, but show only those routes where avg_rating < 3.5.

	AVG(PF.rating) OVER(PARTITION BY TD.route_id ORDER BY TD.route_id) as avg_rating
FROM passenger_feedback as PF
JOIN trip_data AS TD
ON PF.trip_id = TD.trip_id
where avg_rating < 3
